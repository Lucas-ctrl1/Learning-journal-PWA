    <h2>Week 5 - Python & JSON Backend Data</h2>

    <div class="entry-content">

        <h3>1. How is storing data in a JSON file different from using browser storage?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Location and Access:</strong> The JSON file is stored on the local machine's disk or server and can be modified by external programs (like the Python script). Browser storage (Local Storage) is managed entirely by client-side JavaScript within the user's specific browser.</li>
            <li><strong>Scope:</strong> The JSON file provides data persistence outside the browser environment. Local Storage is tied to the browser origin and can be easily cleared by the user, making it less permanent for backend data.</li>
            <li><strong>Updatability:</strong> The JSON file is updated by a separate backend process (Python), whereas Local Storage is updated directly by the PWA's JavaScript.</li>
            <li><strong>Portability:</strong> JSON files can be easily exported, imported, and shared across systems, while browser storage is device-specific and not easily transferable.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. How did you use Python to create or update your JSON file?</h3>
        <p>I used the Python script save_entry.py, combined with the built-in json and datetime modules for robust data handling.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The script prompts the user for journal entry title and content using input().</li>
            <li>It automatically generates a timestamp using datetime.now() for accurate dating.</li>
            <li>It uses json.load() to read the existing list of reflections from reflections.json.</li>
            <li>The new entry (with title, content, timestamp, and source identifier) is appended to the list.</li>
            <li>Finally, it uses json.dump() with proper formatting to save the complete, updated list back to the file.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>3. What does your PWA show locally, and what will users see on GitHub? Are they the same? Why or why not?</h3>
        <p>They are not the same due to different execution environments.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Locally:</strong> The PWA displays a merged view of entries from both Local Storage and the dynamically updated reflections.json file. Users can add entries via both the web form and Python script, and export all data.</li>
            <li><strong>On GitHub Pages:</strong> Users only see entries from Local Storage and the static reflections.json file as it existed at the last commit. GitHub Pages cannot execute the Python script or write to files, making the JSON data read-only.</li>
            <li><strong>Reason:</strong> This demonstrates the fundamental difference between client-side persistence (Local Storage) and server-side file storage with backend processing capabilities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. What extra feature did you add to your PWA using the JSON file, and why?</h3>
        <p>I implemented a comprehensive <strong>Data Export System</strong> that leverages the JSON file structure.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Export Functionality:</strong> Added an "Export All Entries" button that downloads a complete backup of all journal data (both Local Storage entries and Python JSON entries) as a single JSON file.</li>
            <li><strong>Why this feature:</strong> This provides users with complete data ownership and portability. They can backup their learning journey, transfer entries between devices, or use the data for external analysis. It demonstrates practical use of JSON for data interchange.</li>
            <li><strong>Additional Features:</strong> Also included a Reflection Counter showing Python entries count and visual styling to distinguish between browser-saved and Python-saved entries, enhancing user awareness of the dual storage system.</li>
        </ul>

            <h2>Week 4 - Introduction to APIs</h2>
            
            <div class="entry-content">
                <h3>Which Storage, Browser, and Third-Party APIs did you choose, and why?</h3>
                <p>I chose the following APIs to enhance my Learning Journal PWA:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Storage API:</strong> I selected <strong>Local Storage</strong> because it provides a simple and persistent way to save data on the user's device. This was ideal for saving both the user's <strong>journal entries</strong> and their <strong>dark mode theme preference</strong> across browser sessions, fulfilling a core persistence requirement of the lab.</li>
                    <li><strong>Browser API:</strong> I chose the <strong>Notifications API</strong> and the <strong>Clipboard API</strong>. The Notifications API allows for providing <strong>asynchronous feedback</strong> (e.g., confirming an entry was saved or deleted) without interrupting the user's workflow. The Clipboard API offers a modern, secure way to allow users to <strong>copy entry content</strong> with a single click, which significantly improves usability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Third-Party API:</strong> I integrated the <strong>YouTube Data API</strong> to display relevant programming and mobile development videos. This was chosen to integrate <strong>external educational content</strong> directly into the journal app, making it a more comprehensive learning resource.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How did you integrate each API with DOM manipulation?</h3>
                <p>Each API required careful integration with the Document Object Model (DOM):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Integration involves listening for the form <strong>submit event</strong>. Upon submission, data is read from the form elements, formatted, and saved using `storage.saveEntry()`. When the page loads, `JournalApp.loadEntries()` <strong>retrieves all data</strong> and dynamically generates new HTML `div` elements, inserting them into the `#journal-entries` container to display the saved content.</li>
                    <li><strong>Browser APIs:</strong> The Notifications API is triggered via JavaScript calls to `browserAPI.showNotification()` after relevant user actions, ensuring the <strong>DOM remains clean</strong> while providing visual feedback. The Clipboard API is linked to the <strong>"Copy" buttons</strong> within each dynamically created entry, using an event listener to capture the entry's text content before calling `navigator.clipboard.writeText()`.</li>
                    <li><strong>YouTube API:</strong> A button click event triggers `JournalApp.loadYouTubeVideos()`, which fetches the data asynchronously. The app then manipulates the DOM by clearing the `#youtube-videos` container and <strong>dynamically inserting HTML cards</strong> containing the video title, channel, and thumbnail/link.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>What challenges did you encounter, and how did you solve them?</h3>
                <p>The two primary challenges were API reliability and user permissions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Third-Party API Reliability/Quota Limits:</strong> The YouTube Data API has strict usage quotas, which risked the feature breaking if the quota was exceeded. <strong>Solution:</strong> I implemented robust <strong>error handling (`try...catch`)</strong> and created a `getDefaultVideos()` <strong>fallback mechanism</strong> in `thirdparty.js`. If the live API call fails, the app still loads and displays mock video content, ensuring the application remains functional.</li>
                    <li><strong>Notifications API Permissions:</strong> The browser requires explicit user permission to show notifications. <strong>Solution:</strong> I added a check in the `JournalApp.init()` method to gracefully <strong>request permission</strong> if it is still set to 'default', ensuring notifications only display after the user grants permission.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>In what ways do these APIs improve your Learning Journal PWA?</h3>
                <p>The APIs dramatically improve the PWA in three key areas:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Persistence & Reliability:</strong> Using Local Storage means the app no longer loses user data on reload or close, transforming it from a temporary tool into a <strong>reliable personal journal</strong>. The theme preference is also consistently loaded, improving the user experience.</li>
                    <li><strong>User Feedback & Interactivity:</strong> The Notifications and Clipboard APIs enhance the application's responsiveness. The PWA now provides <strong>immediate, clear feedback</strong> on actions and offers a quick utility (copying entries) that improves workflow and efficiency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Educational Value:</strong> The integration of the <strong>YouTube Data API</strong> turns the journal page into a <strong>contextual learning dashboard</strong>. By serving relevant programming videos, it supports the user's ongoing education directly within the application, enhancing its utility beyond simple note-taking.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Week 3 - JavaScript & DOM Manipulation</h2>
            
            <div class="entry-content">
                <h3>Which DOM selection methods did you use, and why did you choose them?</h3>
                <p>I used <strong>getElementById</strong> to target specific elements like the live date and dark mode toggle because it's fast and direct for single elements. I also used <strong>querySelector</strong> for more flexible element selection when needed.</p>
                
                <h3>What was the most challenging part about linking JavaScript with your HTML?</h3>
                <p>The most challenging part was ensuring the JavaScript loaded at the right time using <strong>DOMContentLoaded</strong> and making the reusable navigation work consistently across all pages without manual HTML duplication. Getting the dark mode toggle positioned correctly without overlapping content was also tricky.</p>
                
                <h3>How did you test and debug your JavaScript code?</h3>
                <p>I used <strong>console.log</strong> statements to check if elements were being selected properly and event listeners were working. I also used browser developer tools to test the dark mode CSS changes and fix positioning issues with the toggle button.</p>

            <h2>Week 2 - Frontend Fundamentals</h2>
            
            <div class="entry-content">
                <h3>How did you approach mobile-first design?</h3>
                <p>I started with mobile styles first, then used CSS media queries with min-width to enhance layouts for tablets and desktop screens.</p>
                
                <h3>What was the most useful HTML or CSS concept you applied this week?</h3>
                <p>CSS Flexbox for navigation and CSS Grid for project layouts were incredibly useful for responsive design.</p>
                
                <h3>What part of HTML or CSS did you find most challenging or confusing?</h3>
                <p>Making navigation consistent across pages without JavaScript was manual. Looking forward to automating this with components.</p>
