            <div class="entry-content">
                <h3>How did you approach mobile-first design?</h3>
                <p>I started with mobile styles first, then used CSS media queries with min-width to enhance layouts for tablets and desktop screens.</p>
                
                <h3>What was the most useful HTML or CSS concept you applied this week?</h3>
                <p>CSS Flexbox for navigation and CSS Grid for project layouts were incredibly useful for responsive design.</p>
                
                <h3>What part of HTML or CSS did you find most challenging or confusing?</h3>
                <p>Making navigation consistent across pages without JavaScript was manual. Looking forward to automating this with components.</p>

            <h2>Week 1 - Introduction & PWA Foundations</h2>
            
            <div class="entry-content">
                <h3>Key Achievements:</h3>
                <p>Set up GitHub repository and VS Code integration. Built a Temperature Converter PWA with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Implemented core PWA features including web app manifest and service worker for offline functionality.</p>
                
                <h3>Multi-Platform Deployment:</h3>
                <p>Deployed the PWA to both GitHub Pages and PythonAnywhere for cross-platform testing. Also created my first Android mobile application in Android Studio, comparing PWA vs native development approaches.</p>
                
                <h3>Reflection:</h3>
                <p>Solid introduction to mobile development ecosystems. Experienced both web-based (PWA) and native (Android) development, understanding the strengths of each approach for different use cases.</p>
